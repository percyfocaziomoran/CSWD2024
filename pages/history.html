        <h2>Ping Pong or Table Tennis? What's the difference?</h2>
        <p id="ppVStt">While ping pong and table tennis are very similar, the perception of the two sport names is hugely different: Table tennis is an Olympic sport 
          whereas ping pong is a game played as a sport across the world. Depending on who you ask, you will get a multitude of responses on what the differences between table tennis and ping pong.</p>
        <h2>History of Ping Pong</h2>
        <p id="introHistory">Ping pong originated in England in the early 1900s before the creation of the Ping-Pong Association in 1902. By 1905, the association was broken up, although the game continued to be played across many countries. 
          In 1926, the Fédération Internationale de Tennis de Table was founded with the support of the countries of England, Sweden, Hungary, India, Denmark, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Wales. In London the same year, the world's first 
          table tennis championships were held with players from across the world. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) chose it's name after table tennis instead of ping pong as a result of fears of trademark disputes, as in 1900 the term "ping pong" was 
          trademarked in England. At the time of this decision, there was no difference between ping pong and table tennis and the terms were used entirely interchangeably! </p>
          <p>Until 1939, the table tennis championships were mostly ruled by players from central Europe. However, in the mid-1950s, Asia began to emerge as a major player in table tennis. Since then, Chinese players have dominated competitions and championships. 
          In the 1970s, "Ping Pong Diplomacy" was a phrase born out of a period between China and the United States where tensions were eased as a direct result of a series of publicised table tennis matches between players from the two countries. 1980 marked the first World 
          Cup of table tennis, and by 1988, table tennis became an official Olympic sport, as both a single and doubles event for men and women.</p>
          <p>Today, ping pong is considered one of the most popular sports in the world. While popularity is declining in some countries, scross Asia, and specifically in China, ping pong participation and viewership is still increasing.  </p>
